# Phase 3 Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Test Coverage**: 179/179 tests passing

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 3: Adapter & Definitions (Tickets 11-12)
Successfully implemented and tested data loading from `game_data.json` with full conversion to the engine's `ItemDefinition` format.

### Test Suites Created

1. **Adapter Tests** (`adapter.test.ts`)
   - 34 tests covering structure and unit conversion
   - Full validation of 15 units (3 colonists + 12 ships)
   - Full validation of 35+ structures
   - Type safety verification

2. **Seed Tests** (`seed.test.ts`)
   - 32 tests covering initial state generation
   - Standard and minimal scenario validation
   - Configuration override testing
   - State validity verification

## Implementation Fixes

### Adapter Bug Fix
During test development, discovered and fixed a critical bug in `adapter.ts`:

**Issue**: The game data uses `space_type` for `PROVIDE_SPACE` effects, but the adapter was looking for `category`.

**Fix**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
if (effect.category === 'ground') {
  effects.space_ground_cap = effect.amount || 0;
}

// AFTER (correct)
const spaceType = (effect as any).space_type;
if (spaceType === 'ground') {
  effects.space_ground_cap = effect.amount || 0;
}
```

**Impact**: Now correctly extracts space capacity effects from structures like `land_reclamation` and `orbital_clearing`.
