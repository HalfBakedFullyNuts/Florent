# Test Summary for UI Tickets

## Test File: `tickets.test.tsx`

This file contains comprehensive tests for all the UI improvement tickets (BUG-2, UI-5, UI-6, UI-7, UI-8, UI-9).

## Test Coverage by Ticket

### BUG-2: Queue Display Turn Range Format
- ❌ **Test 1**: Game should start at T1 instead of T0 (Currently starts at T0)
- ✅ **Test 2**: Queue items display with correct format (Component renders)
- ✅ **Test 3**: Shows activation and completion turns (Component structure)

### UI-5: Auto-Advance to Completion & Queue Timeline
- ❌ **Test 1**: Should auto-advance when queueing buildings (Not implemented)
- ❌ **Test 2**: Should NOT auto-advance for ships/colonists (Need to verify)
- ✅ **Test 3**: Turn position indicator in queue display (Component renders)

### UI-6: Sort Queue Items by Duration and Name
- ✅ **Test 1**: Items sorted by duration then alphabetically (Tests sorting logic)

### UI-7: Queue Items Grid Layout and Alignment
- ✅ **Test 1**: Left-aligned instead of center-aligned (Checks for no mx-auto)
- ✅ **Test 2**: Sufficient width for long item names (Checks no max-w constraint)

### UI-8: Display Completed Structures List
- ❌ **Test 1**: Shows "Completed Structures" instead of "Ships" (Not implemented)
- ✅ **Test 2**: Display format for structures (Logic test)
- ❌ **Test 3**: Shows "No structures built" when empty (Needs implementation)

### UI-9: Queue Display Layout - Spacing and Height
- ❌ **Test 1**: Reduced gap between lanes (Currently gap-4)
- ❌ **Test 2**: Increased vertical space (Currently max-h-[400px])
- ✅ **Test 3**: Display more items without scrolling (Component capability)

### Integration Test
- ❌ **Full Workflow**: Tests all improvements together (Multiple failures)

## Current Test Results

**Total Tests**: 16
- **Passing**: 8 ✅
- **Failing**: 8 ❌

## Tests Ready for Implementation

All tests are properly written and will pass once the corresponding tickets are implemented:

1. **BUG-2**: Change initial turn from 0 to 1
2. **UI-5**: Implement auto-advance for buildings
3. **UI-6**: Add sorting to ItemGrid component
4. **UI-7**: Fix grid alignment and width constraints
5. **UI-8**: Replace Ships section with Completed Structures
6. **UI-9**: Adjust spacing and height for queue display

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all ticket tests
npm run test src/app/__tests__/tickets.test.tsx

# Run with watch mode for development
npm run test -- --watch src/app/__tests__/tickets.test.tsx

# Run specific test suite
npm run test -- -t "BUG-2"
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement each ticket's requirements
2. Run tests to verify implementation
3. All tests should pass when tickets are complete
4. Integration test validates the complete user experience

## Test Benefits

- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of requirements
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensures features don't break when making changes
- **Implementation Guide**: Tests show exactly what needs to be built
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates that implementations meet specifications
